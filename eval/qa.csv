networking,What does the application layer do?,"The application layer enables network applications and end-user processes to communicate over a network. It defines protocols and services such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and DNS that provide user-level functions like web browsing, email, and file transfer."
networking,What is TCP congestion control?,"TCP congestion control regulates the rate at which data is sent into the network to avoid overwhelming routers and links. It uses feedback mechanisms like packet loss or delay (timeouts, duplicate ACKs) to adjust the congestion window, applying algorithms such as slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery."
networking,What is the purpose of DNS?,"The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable hostnames (like www.example.com) into IP addresses used by network devices to route packets. It functions as a distributed, hierarchical naming system with caching to improve performance."
networking,Explain the difference between circuit switching and packet switching.,"Circuit switching establishes a dedicated communication path for the entire session, reserving resources end-to-end (as in telephone networks). Packet switching divides data into packets that are routed independently through the network, allowing efficient sharing of resources (as in the Internet)."
architecture,Explain pipeline hazards.,"Pipeline hazards are conditions that prevent the next instruction in the pipeline from executing during its designated clock cycle. They include structural hazards (hardware resource conflicts), data hazards (instruction dependencies), and control hazards (branching). Solutions include forwarding, stalling, and branch prediction."
architecture,What is cache coherence?,"Cache coherence ensures that multiple caches in a multiprocessor system maintain a consistent view of shared data. When one processor updates a cached value, all other caches either invalidate or update their copies. Common protocols include MESI (Modified, Exclusive, Shared, Invalid) and directory-based methods."
architecture,What is Amdahl's Law?,"Amdahl’s Law quantifies the potential speedup of a program when part of it is improved or parallelized. It states that overall performance gain is limited by the fraction of the program that cannot benefit from the improvement. Speedup = 1 / ((1 - P) + (P / S)), where P is the parallel portion and S is the speedup of that portion."
architecture,Explain instruction-level parallelism (ILP).,"Instruction-level parallelism is the degree to which instructions can be executed simultaneously in a processor pipeline. Techniques such as pipelining, superscalar execution, and out-of-order issue exploit ILP to increase throughput without raising clock speed."
